There are plenty of tools for you to start your own website, but making a decent website for free with total control over the design is something beautiful. Beautiful means well designed and functional, the best website for you is the one you craft yourself.

>Jekyll is a simple, blog aware, static site generator.

[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) lets you create a static website in a few minutes and host it on [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com) for free. Static sites have minimal server-side activity and serve mostly static content. Blogs, resumes, marketing websites, landing pages, and documentation are all good candidates for static websites. Jekyll is widely used and popular on the web.

With Jekyll, you write your content using [Markdown](http://daringfireball/markdown). It will convert your markdown content into web presentable HTML and wrap it with the styling you specified. You'll have total control over how it is stylised and presented on the web. You can add any number of pages and even make sure each page to have a separate layout, if that is something you want. 

Advantages of a static website are:

* They are fast as there is no database to get content from.
* Modifying website is easy as all files are available in you local machine.
* No need to pay fees to use custom domain name
* Free hosting on Github

There are always two sides of a coin, the disadvantages being you depend on a third party service like [Disqus](http://disqus.com) for managing your blog comments.

Want to get started with a Jekyll website? There are so many tutorials all over the web, you can follow anyone. If you want to build from scratch, [TutsPlus] (http://code.tutsplus.com/articles/building-static-sites-with-jekyll--net-22211) has a nice tutorial. If youâ€™re in hurry, use [Jekyll Bootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com) to host website directly to your Github account within three minutes.

This website on which you're reading this article is hosted on Github and built using Jekyll, so go out and make a yourself a website.
