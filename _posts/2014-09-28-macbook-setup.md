title: Macbook Setup for Development
---
 Recently I started  using Mac OSX for my development needs, got myself a 2014 version Macbook Air last month. It has been a month and it is my new precious. I get around ten hours of charge which is phenomenal. 

 After a lot of searching and recommendations about which applications to use , this is how I ended up setting up  my macbook for web development.  

 If you have any comments or suggestions, feel free to give me a shout on [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/rvgpl/)

<h3>Applications</h3>


 * [Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/) : Chrome is the best browser, and Chrome developer tools are the best way to debug errors and learn what happens under the hood.
 * [Chrome Canary](http://www.google.co.in/intl/en/chrome/browser/canary.html) : Chrome Canary allows me to stay ahead with the new features as they get implemeted to chrome.
 * [iTerm2](http://www.iterm2.com/#/section/home) : Better terminal than the one that comes with OSX. I set up a hotkey `⌘ + ⌥` to open the terminal to half of my screen, something like the [Guake](https://github.com/Guake/guake/) terminal in linux.
 * [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/): my favourite and the best text editor for any programming language. I use it with 'Consolas' font and Monokai theme.
 * [Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com/) : One of the must-have applications on mac, open applications blazingly fast by just  pressing `⌥ + SPACE` and few characters of app name. Once I started using  Alfred, I don't find a use for dock.
 * [Dropbox](http://www.dropbox.com/): Syncs in the background, easy to store important files and other information.
 * [Dash](https://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/40201/dash) : Documentations for every programing language out there. The best part it is offline and searching with Alfred makes you a lot more productive.
 * [Mamp](http://www.mamp.info/en/downloads/index.html):  Apache, PHP and MySQL server. For local Wordpress and PHP development.
 * [Evernote](http://evernote.com/) : If you're not using this piece of awesome software, you must have one hell of a memory. For mortals, this is so awesome, it helps me track ideas, notes and everthing that I always fail to remember.
 * [Anvil](http://anvilformac.com/) : A simple menubar app to manage local sites easily.
 * [Skype](http://www.skype.com) : For video conferences with people who don't want to use Hangouts.

<h3>Command Line </h3>
* [Command Line Tools](https://developer.apple.com/opensource/) :You first need to install xcode to use command line tools or if you don't do iOS development like me you can just install the tools using  `$ xcode-select --install` on a terminal.
* [brew](http://brew.sh/) : `apt-get` for mac. 
* [git](http://github.com) : `brew install git` for version control.
* [zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) : Still haven't strated using it yet but everyone says it is lot better than bash.
