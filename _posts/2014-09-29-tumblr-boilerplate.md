A few days back a friend of mine wanted to get back to blogging, even though I love the minimal setup of  `Jekyll` and Github Pages, it is hard to recommed it for everyone.

After a bit playing around the web, decided [Tumblr](http://www.tumblr.com/) was the platform for him. Tumblr is great for blogging, it supports various types of posts and also has an option to write your posts in `Markdown`. There are tons of themes out there for tumblr but almost all of them were about sharing photos and image galleries. So I decided to build a theme for him.

Tumblr theme [documentation](http://www.tumblr.com/docs/en/custom_themes) does an excellent job in detailing how to build a custom theme from scratch,  so I created a boilerplate based on the documentation to speed up my theme development.

Tumblr allows you to upload static files such as CSS or JS files using their [file uploader](http://www.tumblr.com/themes/upload_static_file), as every web project of mine involves using [normalize.css](http://necolas.github.com/normalize.css/),  I added it to my boilerplate.

This boilerplate supports all types of posts that Tumblr allows, you can download it from [here](https://github.com/rvgpl/tumblr-boilerplate/archive/master.zip).

##Custom Theme
Here is the theme I developed for my friend,

I added this theme to my [Behance Portfolio](https://www.behance.net/gallery/20087509/Minimal-Blog-Tumblr-Theme), so if you like my work do appreciate it there.
