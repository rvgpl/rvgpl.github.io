The last two months have been pretty good. Life-changing moments have come one after another and I now find myself in Bengaluru working for one of the awesome startups with some amazing people.

With stress-free and relaxed routine at office, I end up doing a lot more work than I ever thought I could. This changed the way I work, from how I now use my editor to how I pick names for my functions. Learning a lot of good practices and patterns by pair programming with my really awesome people.

Bengaluru as a city has been really good so far if you ignore the times I got stuck in traffic. It has interesting conferences to attend, swanky resturants to dine and many interesting people to meet and enjoy. Looking forward to everything this city has to offer.
