	<h1 class="pageTitle">About me</h1>
	
	<p class="intro">Hey there! I'm Ravigopal Kesari.</p>
	<p>I'm always looking for a new challenge. Every day something new comes out in the world of design and development and along with that comes new problems to solve. Tackling these problems helps me to grow as a thinker, as a designer, as a developer and as a creative in general.</p>
  <p>I like to build awesome applications and learn about how to do get better at it everyday. I do experiments with what I learn, most of my decent code is on my <a href="http://github.com/rvgpl">Github</a>.<p>
  <p>Through practice, I’ve reach the point where I’ve gain confidence in presenting myself as a photographer. I continue to learn new techniques everyday and getting comfortable with the intricacies of operating the camera. 
I spend most of my time reading articles on web or books.</p>
